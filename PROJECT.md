# retreat-api project reference

## Product and working agreement

QR-based retreat operations for guests, cleaning staff, and one administrator.
Five properties initially; a sixth may follow. Client-facing text is Korean;
code and technical documentation are English.

Implement one approved slice at a time. The user controls staging, commits,
pushes, database migrations, and deployment. After implementation, report the
checks performed and provide one commit message. Keep unrelated user changes.

## Runtime decisions

- NestJS 11 and TypeScript, managed with npm.
- Local configuration in .env only; no .env.example.
- Default port 3100.
- No global /api prefix.
- PostgreSQL through Prisma is the next database slice.
- The user runs npx prisma migrate dev --name <name> for development migrations.
- Runtime environment variables override .env.

## Structure

- src/main.ts: process startup, listening, graceful shutdown.
- src/config/: validated runtime settings and shared HTTP setup.
- src/components/: one module per feature, registered in components.module.ts.
- src/libs/dto/<feature>/: input DTOs and response contracts.
- src/libs/filters/: common exception handling.
- src/database/: reserved for the Prisma module in Slice 2.

This follows the familiar Jagong module and DTO organization. Keep feature
logic in its own service when needed. Avoid creating empty feature modules.

## HTTP conventions

- English routes; Korean user-facing messages.
- Use request DTO classes with class-validator decorators.
- Unexpected properties and invalid DTO values return 400.
- Implicit type conversion is disabled. Add explicit conversions where needed.
- Return typed success payloads directly; errors use the common error response.
- Public errors use an HttpException subclass with an object containing code
  and message. Example: BadRequestException({ code: 'INVALID_STAY',
  message: '이용 일정을 확인해 주세요.' }).
- Unmarked HTTP error messages fall back to safe Korean status messages.
- All 5xx messages are generic in responses; diagnostic stacks stay in server
  logs. Error paths omit query strings.
- Validation errors add an errors array of field names and messages. Never
  include input values or sensitive data in validation message templates.
- CORS is an origin allowlist, with credentials disabled. It is not authorization.
- Configure production and HTTP tests through the same configureApp function.

## Slice 1 completion boundary

GET /health returns application liveness, not database or storage readiness.
The old starter routes were removed. Tests cover environment validation and
the shared HTTP behavior. Authentication, Prisma, business records, and uploads
remain unimplemented.

## Confirmed domain constraints for later slices

- Guest and staff QR links are separate per property.
- A QR resolves context; it does not independently verify a person's identity.
- Staff upload after-cleaning photos; before photos are not required.
- Descriptions/photos for reported defects are optional.
- Manager confirmation closes an issue; normal cleaning completion is separate.
- Preserve original submitted wording and answers when checklist templates change.
- Keep correction and cancellation history.
- Guest editing, bulk checklist updates, room interpretation, Excel details, and
  report format await the current client clarification.
- Calendar, roster import, and missing-submission detection are separate slices.
